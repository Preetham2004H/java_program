Sure, let's go through these Java concepts one by one:
- public static void main: This is the entry point for any Java program. The main method must be public so that JVM can call it from outside the class, static so that JVM can call it without creating an instance of the class, and void because it doesn't return anything.
- Abstract Class: An abstract class in Java is a class that can't be instantiated, which means you cannot create an object of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses. An abstract class can have abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (regular methods with a body).
- User Interface: In the context of Java, a user interface can be created using various tools provided in the Java foundation classes like Swing, AWT, JavaFX. These tools allow you to create interactive GUIs with buttons, text fields, panels, etc.
- Inheritance: Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class. The class which inherits the properties of another class is known as subclass (or derived class, child class), and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (or base class, parent class).
- Super Keyword: In Java, super is a reference variable that is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method, to invoke immediate parent class constructor, and to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
- final: The final keyword in Java is used to restrict the user. It can be used in many contexts. Final can be: a variable, a method, or a class. If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of the final variable (It will be constant).
- Overriding Methods: In Java, a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class or superclass. This process is known as method overriding. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to provide the specific implementation of the method.
- Overloading Methods: Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters. It is used to increase the readability of the program.
- Constructors: In Java, a constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. A constructor resembles an instance method in Java but it’s not a method as it doesn’t have a return type.
- Access Modifiers: In Java, access modifiers are used to set the accessibility (visibility) of classes, interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, etc. There are four types of Java access modifiers: Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.
- this keyword: In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It can be used to refer to the instance variable of the current class, to invoke the method of the current class, to invoke the constructor of the current class, etc.
- Instance variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. Class variables: Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block. Local variables: Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
- Difference between overloading and overriding methods: Overloading is the phenomenon that the method/function has the same name but different parameters. Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class, and the other is in the child class.
- OOPs principles: The main principles of OOPs are:
    - Abstraction: It is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
    - Encapsulation: It is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
    - Inheritance: It is a process where one class acquires the properties of another.
    - Polymorphism: It is a process where one task is performed by different ways.
- ToString() and Hash Code Methods: The toString() method returns the string representation of the object. If you print any object, java compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the object. The hashCode() method returns the hash code value of the object.
- Exception Handling: Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors. It is mainly used to handle checked exceptions.
- Try catch: try is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. catch is used to handle the exception.
- Multi-threading: Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
- Different ways of creating threads: There are two ways to create a thread in Java: by extending the Thread class and by implementing the Runnable interface.
- Wrapper classes: Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
- Boxing, Auto Boxing and Unboxing: Boxing is the process of converting a primitive data type into an object of the corresponding wrapper class. Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. Unboxing is the process of converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value.
